[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@randajan/queue.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@randajan/queue) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

__Tiny javascript library to pack many calling of the same function to one execution__

This project implements a task queue for delayed processing in JavaScript. The task queue is designed to be flexible and robust, allowing you to capture and process small tasks and execute them all at once. This task queue is a useful tool for managing asynchronous operations in JavaScript and can be used in your application to efficiently handle task processing.

## Features
- **Task Processing**: Ability to add tasks to the queue and execute the bulk processing of these tasks.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Option to set various parameters for the task queue, including time limits and the method of passing arguments to the task processing function.
- **Processing the Last Task**: Special "last" parameter allows easy filtering and processing of only the last task in the queue.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple creation and usage of the task queue using a straightforward API.

## Installation
To install the package, use npm:
npm install @your-package-name

## Usage
```javascript

// Import the module
import { createQueue } from '@randajan/queue';

// Define the tasks processing function
const processTasks = (tasks) => { console.log(tasks); }

// Create a queue
const queue = createQueue(processTasks, { softMs: 100 });

// Add tasks to the queue
queue('task1');
queue('task2');
```

## API

### `createQueue(processQueue, options)`
Creates a new task queue.

Return of this call will be a function that will push any arguments to the queue for later procesing via processQueue. Pushing arguments into queue return a Promise that will eventually resolve with the result of calling processQueue function.


#### `processQueue` (required)
A function that processes tasks in the queue. It must be passed as the first parameter when creating the queue. Without this function, the queue has no purpose and will result in an error.

#### `options` (optional)
An object containing configuration options for the queue:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-|-|-|
| **softMs** | `0` | The soft time limit (in milliseconds) before executing the task processing function after the last task is added to the queue. If tasks keep coming in before this time limit is reached, the execution of the tasks will be delayed. |
| **hardMs** | `0` | The hard time limit (in milliseconds) before forcefully executing the task processing function, regardless of whether new tasks are added or not. |
| **maxSize** | `0` | The maximum size of the queue. Once the queue reaches this size, the task processing function will be executed immediately. Value `0` means no maximum size limit. |
| **returnResult** | false | When true the queue Promise will wait and return the result of the processQueue call |
| **args** | [] | Arguments that will be passed to the `processQueue` function |
| **pass** | "all" | Specifies how tasks are passed to the `processQueue` function. Possible values are:<br>- `"all"`: All tasks in the queue are passed as an array at the beginning of the arguments to the `processQueue` function.<br>- `"first"`: Only the first task in the queue is passed as individual arguments to the `processQueue` function.<br>- `"last"`: Only the last task in the queue is passed as individual arguments to the `processQueue` function. |

## Extra
There is extra properties that is append to the function retrieved from calling `createQueue(...)`

| Parameter | Description |
|-|-|
| **isPending** | Indicates whether there are tasks pending in the queue. Returns `true` if there are pending tasks, otherwise `false`.             |
| **size**      | Returns the current size of the queue.                                                                                             |
| **startAt**   | Returns the timestamp when the first task was added to the queue. If there is no tasks it returns `undefined`. |
| **softEndAt** | Returns the timestamp when the soft time limit for executing tasks after the last task was added to the queue ends. If there is no tasks it returns `undefined`. |
| **hardEndAt**  | Returns the timestamp when the hard time limit for executing tasks forcibly ends, regardless of whether new tasks are added. If there is no tasks or the hard time limit is not active, it returns `undefined`. |
